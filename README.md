1. Opens Webcam a.k.a. The Mirror of Erised 
   The wizard peers into the mirror and says, “Show me my true self!” But really, it’s just your boring webcam.

2. Captures Background a.k.a. The Empty Classroom at Hogwarts 
   The wizard spends 60 awkward seconds staring at nothing, whispering, “Memorize this wall… memorize this wall…”

3. Flips Everything 
   Because Hogwarts magic is confusing, everything is flipped horizontally—like reading spells in a mirror.

4. Searches for Red 
   The code goes on a scavenger hunt for anything red:

   If you wore a red cloak, congrats, you’re about to disappear.
   If your mom walks by in a red saree, poof, she’s gone too.
   If you hold a tomato 🍅, the tomato enters another dimension.

5. Background + Cloak Swap 
   Your red cloak is swapped with the background, so instead of wearing it, you’re now… a floating head and hands! Perfect for scaring muggles.

7. Final Result 
   The screen shows a *“discount invisibility cloak” effect—more like “partially transparent, slightly glitchy, tomato-vanishing cloak”.

8. Exit
   Press ESC to stop being a wizard and go back to being a boring muggle.

**I SUGGEST YOU TO PASTE THIS CODE IN PYCHARM AND CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEN INSTALL opencv and numpy and then you are ready to do the magic !!!!!!!!!!**
